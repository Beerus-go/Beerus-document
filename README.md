# Beerus-document

This is the documentation for beerus, open sourced so that anyone interested can maintain it together

The English documentation in particular is a nightmare for people like me who are terrible at English and rely heavily on machine translation, which can be inaccurate in many ways

The documentation is written in vuePress
